# AzFlag

### This project is a simple web application that dynamically renders the flag of Azerbaijan using the HTML5 <canvas> element. The flag adapts to the browser's window size, maintaining the aspect ratio and resizing responsively.

# Features

* Dynamic Canvas Resizing: The canvas adjusts its dimensions based on the window size, ensuring the flag is always displayed optimally.
* Accurate Flag Representation: Horizontal stripes in the correct colors: blue, red, and green.
* A crescent and an eight-pointed star rendered precisely in the center stripe.
Interactive and Responsive Design: The flag updates automatically on window resize events.

# Steps to Run

1. Copy the provided code into an HTML file (e.g., index.html).
2. Open the file in any web browser.
3. Resize the browser window to see the flag dynamically adjust its size.
